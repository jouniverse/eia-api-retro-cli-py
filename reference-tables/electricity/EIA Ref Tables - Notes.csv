"Generation Only BA column indicates if a balancing authority is ""generation only"" meaning the balancing authority consists of a power plant or group of power plants and does not directly serve retail customers. Therefore, they only report net generation and interchange and do not report demand or demand forecasts."
"Demand by BA Subregion column indicates if a balancing authority reports demand for subregions (e.g., load zones, weather zones, operating company areas, local balancing authorities, etc.) within their system."
